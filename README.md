# Welcome to my GitHub!

__My name is Godwin. I'm interested in coding in JavaScript and Python. I'm also the best ukulele player you will ever meet.__

## I'm currently working on...

- [Secret Keys](https://demo-day-markup.onrender.com): Building geolocated online platforms for businesses to allure people with secret deals, menu items, and postings, helping to strengthen their community and online presence simultaneously. ([GitHub Repo](https://github.com/godwinKamau/demo-day-markup))

## Fun Projects

- [Music Calculator](https://github.com/godwinKamau/complex-api2): An API caller to help expand your music tastes. Place 3 artists that you like into the inputs and find some new music to listen to. 
- [Secret Messages](https://github.com/godwinKamau/express-auth2): Place messages by using the geolocation API. Only people within 1 km will be able to see it (practice for secret keys).
- [Pick a Card](https://github.com/godwinKamau/matching-card): Call the Pexels API to search for pictures to populate your matching game.
