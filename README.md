## Welcome to my GitHub!

__My name is Godwin. I'm interested in coding in JavaScript and Python. I'm also the best ukulele player you will ever meet.__

### I'm currently working on...

- [Secret Keys](https://demo-day-markup.onrender.com): Building geolocated sites for businesses to allure people with secret deals and build there community and online presence simultaneously.

### Fun Projects

- [Music Calculator](godwinkamau.Agithub.io/complex-api/): An API caller to help expand your music tastes. Place 3 artists that you like into the inputs and find some new music to listen to. 
- [Secret Messages](https://express-auth2.onrender.com): Place messages by using the geolocation API. Only people within 1 km will be able to see it (practice for secret keys).
- [Pick a Card](https://matching-card.onrender.com): Call the Pexels API to search for pictures to populate your matching game.

### Currently Learning...

- The ins and outs of the MERN(MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) stack for fullstack development.
